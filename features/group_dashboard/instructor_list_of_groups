Feature: View instructors assigned groups
  As an instructor
  I want to be able to see what groups I am in charge of
  So I can quickly navigate through them and monitor how are they going

  Background: I am a logged in instructor with some groups assigned
    Given settings set


  Scenario: See my assigned groups
    And I am on the "View my groups" page
    Then I should see "Backstreet Buoys"
    And I should see "Space Girls"
    And I should not see "N Sunk"

  Scenario: Clicking on a group
    And I am on the "View my groups" page
    And I click on "Backstreet Buoys"
    Then I should be on the "Group Dashboard" page
    And I should see "Backstreet Buoys"
